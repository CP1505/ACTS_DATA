                Strato Volcanoes comprise the largest percentage (~60%) of the Earth's individual volcanoes and most are
                characterized by eruptions of <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">andesite</a> and <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">dacite</a> - lavas that are cooler and more viscous than <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">besalt</a>.
                These more viscous lavas allow gas pressures to build up to high levels (they are effective "plugs" in
                the
                plumbing), therefore these volcanoes often suffer explosive eruptions.

                    Strato volcanoes are usually about half-half lava and <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">pyroclastic</a> material, and the layering of
                    these
                    products gives them their other common name of composite volcanoes. <br> <br>

                    This is a schematic diagram of a strato volcano, intended to illustrate the different layers of
                    different
                    materials that comprise them. The purple colors are meant to represent ash layers, either the
                    products of
                    fall-out from big eruption clouds or the products of pyroclastic flows. Notice that these ash layers
                    tend to
                    be thin but widespread. The orange colors represent lava flows, and note that some of them have
                    cinder cones
                    associated with them at the vent. The green colors are meant to represent lava domes, and notice
                    that they
                    do not flow very far. Each eruption, regardless of what it produces, is fed from the <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">magma chember</a>
                    by a
                    <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">dikes</a>. Most dikes come up through the center of the volcano and therefore most eruptions occur from
                    at or
                    near the summit. However, some dikes head off sideways to feed eruptions on the flanks.

                    This is a pit that has been dug into the ground at Cotopaxi, a big strato volcano near Quito, the
                    capital
                    city of Ecuador. The pit is about 2 meters deep and in it you can clearly see a number of ash layers
                    exposed. It is also easy to see that the layers are different - some are coarse and others are fine,
                    some
                    are dark-colored and others are light-colored.

                    The lava at strato volcanoes occasionally forms <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">'a'a,</a> but more commonly it barely flows at all,
                    preferring
                    to pile up in the vent to form volcanic domes. Some strato volcanoes are just a collection of domes
                    piled up
                    on each other. Strato volcanoes are commonly found along subduction-related volcanic arcs, and the
                    <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">magma</a>
                    supply rates to strato volcanoes are lower. This is the cause of the cooler and differentiated magma
                    compositions and the reason for the usually long <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">repos</a> periods between eruptions. Examples of
                    strato
                    volcanoes include Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Rainier, Pinatubo, Mt. Fuji, Merapi, Galeras, Cotopaxi, and
                    super
                    plenty others.
